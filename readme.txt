# Dice Game

This is a simple dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each time the page reloads, the game "rolls" two dice and displays which player rolled the higher number. If both players roll the same number, it declares a tie.

## Features

- **Automatic Dice Roll on Page Reload**: The game rolls the dice every time the page is refreshed.
- **Simple User Interface**: The game displays two dice, one for each player, and shows the result.
- **Determines the Winner**: It compares the dice rolls and displays a message indicating the winner or if it's a tie.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Each time the page reloads, a new roll is simulated for both players.
3. The game will display the results, indicating which player rolled a higher number or if it's a tie.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the game.
- **style.css**: Adds basic styling to the game elements.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic to roll the dice and determine the winner.
